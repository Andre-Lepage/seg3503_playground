This would test the getCell method. At first I created the test that verified my desires, ran it, and saw that it failed, then I implemented the code until the test passed <br> Test: <br><br> ![cell test](photos/get_cell_test.png "cell test") <br><br> Implementation: <br> ![cell impl](photos/get_cell_implementation.png "cell impl") |
